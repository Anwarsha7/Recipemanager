## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (includes npm)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (for local database setup, or use a cloud-hosted MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Anwarsha7/Recipemanager.git](https://github.com/Anwarsha7/Recipemanager.git)
    cd Recipemanager
    ```

2.  **Frontend Setup:**
    Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Backend Setup:**
    Navigate to the `backend` directory and install dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with your environment variables (e.g., `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`). Refer to the backend's `config` or `example.env` file for required variables.

## Running Locally

To run the application on your local machine, you'll need to start both the frontend and backend servers.

#### Important Note for Frontend Development:

**Before trying to run the frontend locally, remember to change the API endpoint from `https://recipemanager-ma43.onrender.com` to `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port your backend runs on locally, if different from 3000).** This change is typically made in your frontend's environment configuration file or a constant file (e.g., `.env`, `config.js`, `constants.js`).

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    Navigate to your `backend` directory and start the server.

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    ```
    Your backend should now be running, likely on `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Server:**
    Navigate to your `frontend` directory and start the development server.

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev # Or npm start, depending on your Vite setup
    ```
    This will usually open the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port like 3001, depending on your frontend framework).
